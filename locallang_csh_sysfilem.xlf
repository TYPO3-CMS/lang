        <source>By creating a file mount record and placing a reference to it in a Backend usergroup you can allow a user access to the file mount in the File&gt;List module.
Filemounts may also configure access to a path on the server to which the user has FTP-access. Just remember to set file-permissions on the server correctly so the webserver user (which PHP is running as) has at least read access to the FTP-dir.
You can only mount absolute paths if they are within the base path set in $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[BE][lockRootPath]</source>

        <source>If BASE is set to relative, the path mounted is found in the subfolder "fileadmin/" of the website. Then you should enter the subfolder in "fileadmin/" as path. For instance if you want to mount access to "fileadmin/user_uploads/all/" then enter the value "user_uploads/all" as the value of PATH.
If BASE is absolute you should enter the absolute path on the server, eg. "/home/ftp_upload" or "C:/home/ftp_upload". Further you must make sure the configuration variable $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[BE][lockRootPath] contains the first part of the path you want to mount.

&lt;strong&gt;Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; In any case, make sure the webserver user which PHP is running as has &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; read-access to the path. If not, the mount will simply not appear without any warnings.
If you have problems - especially with absolute mounts - try to mount something "simple" like a relative path in fileadmin. If that is working well, try the absolute path.

Your PHP-configuration may also impose other restrictions on you if open_basedir is enabled. Then use relative paths.</source>
