				<source>The pages table is the very backbone in TYPO3. All records editable by the mainstream modules in TYPO3 must 'belong' to a page. It's exactly like files and folders on your computers harddrive.

&lt;b&gt;The page tree&lt;/b&gt;
The pages are organized in a tree structure which is not only a very handy way of organizing in general but also a optimal reflection of how you should organize the pages on your website. And thus you'll normally find that the page tree is a reflection of the website navigation itself.

&lt;p&gt;uid, pid and the pagetree root&lt;/b&gt;
Technically all database elements has a field 'uid' which is a unique identification number. Further they must have a field 'pid' which holds the uid-number of the page (page id) to which they belong. If the 'pid' field is zero the record is found in the so called 'root'. Only administrators are allowed access to the root and furthermore table records must be configured to either belonging to a page or being found in the root.

&lt;b&gt;Storage of database records&lt;/b&gt;
Depending on the 'Type' of the page, it may also represent a general storage for database elements in TYPO3. In that case it is not necessarily available as a webpage but only internally in the page tree as a place to store items such as users, subscriptions etc. Such pages are typically of the type "SysFolder".</source>

				<source>Basically 'TypoScript' is a concept for entering values in a tree-structure. This is known especially in relation to creating templates for TYPO3 websites.
However the same principle for entering the hierarchy of values is used here to configure various features in relation to the backend, functions in modules, the Rich Text Editor etc.
The resulting 'TSconfig' for a page is actually an accumulation of all 'TSconfig' values from the root of the page tree and outwards to the current page. And thus all subpages are affected as well. A print of the page TSconfig is available from the 'Page TSconfig' menu in the 'Web&gt;Info' module (requires the extension "info_pagetsconfig" to be installed).</source>
