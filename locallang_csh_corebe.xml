			<label index=".alttitle">TYPO3 Core</label>
			<label index=".description">TYPO3 is a Content Management Framework which consists of a central program core with only limited functionality. To extend this core system there are hundreds of extensions which in combination will provide a very capable system.</label>
			<label index=".details">For most people TYPO3 is equivalent to a CMS providing a backend for management of the content and a frontend engine for website display. However TYPO3s core is natively designed to be a general purpose framework for management of database content. The core of TYPO3 delivers a set of principles for storage of this content, user access management, editing of the content, uploading and managing files etc. Many of these principles are expressed as an API (Application Programmers Interface) for use in the &lt;em&gt;extensions&lt;/em&gt; which ultimately adds most of the real functionality.</label>

			<label index="menu_modules.alttitle">Backend modules</label>
			<label index="menu_modules.description">The Backend menu reflects the hierarchy of main- and sub-modules in TYPO3. Click a menu item to access the corresponding module.</label>
			<label index="menu_modules.details">Backend Users might see different menu items depending on their access permissions. The &quot;Admin&quot; user on a system will always see all modules available.

You can configure the backend to display the menu in two alternative versions (useful on smaller screens); As a selector box or list of icons in the top frame of the backend.

When you click the little &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; icons next to the main modules, you can collapse (-) or expand (+) all the sub modules. By selecting the &quot;Expand all&quot; check box, all items are expanded. When the checkbox is unselected again, the menu changes back to the previous folding state. If you click &quot;Expand all&quot; and collapse a main module afterwards, the previous folding state is discarded and &quot;Expand all&quot; is unselected again.</label>

For another backend user it might be different. This screen shot shows how another user has different permissions set and therefore access to other modules only. Also the backend language has been set different for this user.</label>
			<label index="menu_adminFunction.alttitle">Admin Functions</label>
			<label index="menu_adminFunction.description">The Admin Functions allow administrators to clear caches etc.</label>
			<label index="menu_adminFunction.details">TYPO3 has multiple caching systems:

&lt;b&gt;Database Cache&lt;/b&gt;
A very central cache is the database cache table, &quot;cache_hash&quot;, which needs to be flushed after certain major changes in the system. You &quot;clear all cache&quot; by clicking the link with the blue icon. After this operation any website content should be re-generated from the sources rather than be delivered from caches. This operation clears &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; database tables registered as flushable cache tables.

&lt;b&gt;Cached PHP configuration files from Extensions&lt;/b&gt;
TYPO3 also caches small configuration scripts from extensions, &quot;ext_localconf.php&quot; and &quot;ext_tables.php&quot;. These files are simply read from all installed extensions and concatenated into temporary PHP scripts found in the typo3conf/ folder, named &quot;temp_CACHED_*.php&quot;. Sometimes you need to remove these files so TYPO3 re-writes them from the originals. This is done by the &quot;Clear temp_CACHED&quot; link.

&lt;b&gt;Notice:&lt;/b&gt; You should not clear these caches without a second thought. Clearing caches may affect performance on your server negatively for a while. Obviously the cached content has to be regenerated which takes time and under heavy load it might make your server un-available for a while.</label>

			<label index="pagetree.alttitle">The Page Tree</label>
			<label index="pagetree.description">This is the hierarchical organization of pages in TYPO3. Typically websites are build so they reflect the page structure in the page tree directly in the website navigation.</label>
			<label index="pagetree.details">The page tree works like a file system. Each page is like a directory where you can store files. In TYPO3 you store database records inside of each page. Some of these records, typically called &quot;Content Elements&quot;, contains the website content of pages. Other records can be from plugins like a glossary or a guestbook and they are only displayed indirectly by a plugin inserted as a Content Element.
Some backend users will see only a part of the page tree for a website. This feature allows the administrator to configure backend users with different responsibilities for maintaining branches of the page tree.

&lt;b&gt;Navigating the tree&lt;/b&gt;
Simply click the +/- buttons to expand and contract the branches of the tree.
If you click the page icons you should see a context menu pop up. It will contain options specifically for that page.
Clicking the title of a page is another option. It will load the right frame of the Web main module with the selected sub-module. The content shown in the right frame will be related to the page clicked.</label>

			<label index="pagetree.image_descr">An example of a Page Tree in TYPO3. The page tree is available under any of the Web sub-modules in the menu.
Clicking the icon of a page displays a context sensitive menu with options for that particular page.
Clicking the title of a page in the page tree will load the right frame with the current submodule. The page id is passed to the module so it displays content related to the page you clicked.
Holding the mouse pointer over a page icon for a few seconds will display tool-tip information telling you details about the state of the page. Here a page is access restricted and you will be told which group the access is set for by the tool-tip.</label>
			<label index="filetree.alttitle">The Folder Tree</label>
			<label index="filetree.description">Shows the directory structure of a mounted path on the webserver. You can browse the folder tree like you are used to browse the file system on your own computer.</label>
			<label index="filetree.details">The Folder Tree is available for any sub-module of the File main module in TYPO3. The File module is like a little web-based FTP-client inside of TYPO3 which allows you to upload, rename, copy, move, delete and edit files inside TYPO3.
Most users of TYPO3 doesn't need access to the File module and sub-modules in order to upload images on web-pages. They can do this directly when editing Content Elements. But the File module is useful for maintaining collections of files on the server, for example an image archive or files for download.

&lt;b&gt;Navigating the Folder Tree&lt;/b&gt;
You can expand and contract the folder tree by the +/- icons.
Clicking a folder icon will display a pop-up menu with options related to that particular folder. Options include copy/cut/paste, rename, upload etc.
Clicking the folder title will load the currently active sub-module in the right frame of the backend. The sub-module will typically show files and folders inside the folder you clicked.

&lt;b&gt;Granting access to the Folder Tree&lt;/b&gt;
The administrator needs to allow backend users to access the File modules and in addition make a file mount available to them before they can use the Folder Tree.</label>

			<label index="list_module.alttitle">The Web&gt;List module</label>
			<label index="list_module.description">Listing records located on a page. From here you can copy/cut/paste records around in the system. You can edit records, access the change history of elements etc.</label>
			<label index="list_module.details">The list module is like the file manager in an Operating System; it provides basic access to all &quot;elements&quot; available in the system. In TYPO3 almost all information is stored in the database and managed after the same principles internally. For instance Content Elements representing page content are database records just like backend users are. The Web&gt;List module allows us to create, modify and delete both kinds of records after the same principles.

The Web&gt;List module might not be the best &quot;view&quot; of the content on a page for any situation. For instance if you want to manage website content on a page (Content Elements) you should rather use the &quot;Web&gt;Page&quot; module which is designed to display content elements more optimized. But the List module will always give you access to whatever is on the page in a basic way if no better module is available for management.

&lt;b&gt;Single-table mode&lt;/b&gt;
If you click the tabel title in the listing you will enter single-table mode. In this mode you can select additional fields from the table to show in the listing. Also you will get additional editing facilities, for instance you will be able to edit multiple records at a time and even only certain fields from those records. See the screenshot for more details.</label>

			<label index="list_module_root.details">Only records from certain database tables are allowed to be created in the page tree root. This includes Backend Users, Backend Groups, File Mount records, Language records etc., and you cannot create Content Elements or Frontend Users in the root of the Page Tree. It also works the other way around; For example you cannot create Backend Users anywhere in the page tree.
Usually records that are located in the page tree root are somehow &quot;global&quot; for the whole TYPO3 installation and doesn't make sense inside a specific branch of the page tree.</label>

			<label index="history_log.details">By default 20 states of history data is preserved in TYPO3 and after a week it expires. The history is very useful for tracking changes to a record since you can see which user did what at which point in time - and roll back any changes you didn't like.
If you click the roll-back pencil you will revert the element to the state it had at that particular time.
If you click the Info icon you will see in detail what the difference is from current time to this state of the element.

&lt;b&gt;Configuring levels and expire times [for admins]&lt;/b&gt;
If you want to extend the number of history states to above the default 20 you can easily do so using Page TSconfig - meaning that it can even depend on the branch of the page tree where the record is stored! See link below.

			<label index="TCEforms.details">&lt;b&gt;Saving content&lt;/b&gt;
Just press one of the save-buttons in the top of bottom of the form. There are some variants allowing you to &quot;Save and close document&quot; or &quot;Save document and View page&quot;. The latter will save the document and open a new window where the affected page is shown (be sure to disable pop-up blockers for this function!)

&lt;b&gt;Secondary options (palettes)&lt;/b&gt;
Fields in the editing forms are prioritized so that certain fields of generally lesser interest is moved to a so called &quot;palette&quot;. By default it means that the fields appears in the top frame when you enter the field to which the secondary fields are associated. But you can also enable the fields to be shown in the main form which is more convenient some times - just select the &quot;Show secondary options&quot; checkbox (bottom of page).

&lt;b&gt;Editing multiple records at a time&lt;/b&gt;
From the Web&gt;List module you can activate editing of multiple records at a time. This is done when you list a single table and enable multiple columns for display (see Web&gt;List module for details) - then icons will link you to a form with multiple records displayed, possibly with only certain fields available for editing.

&lt;b&gt;Frontend Editing&lt;/b&gt;
Another way of editing records in TYPO3 is using the website frontend. Depending on your user credentials you will see small pencil icons in the frontend. When you click these you will be guided to a form where you can also change the content.

&lt;b&gt;Customize the forms [for Admins]&lt;/b&gt;
You can customize the TCEforms in many ways using User TSconfig and Page TSconfig. See links below.</label>

			<label index="TCEforms.image_descr">This is how a typical record is edited in TYPO3. The form display is standardized for all types of records. You will always see the same buttons in the top for saving or closing. In the blue bar you will see the type of record (table name) and the ID number that each record has (uid). Here the record is a page with ID &quot;2&quot; and the title &quot;Content Elements&quot;.
In the bottom of the editing page you will find additional options for the interface. You can select &quot;Show field descriptions&quot; if you want a small text shown for each element that explains what it is used for. Also &quot;Show secondary options&quot; is very important since it will show additional form fields in the main forms (from &quot;palettes&quot;).
Here &quot;Show secondary options (palettes)&quot; is enabled. The result is that a number of additional fields of &quot;lower priority&quot; is shown under the &quot;Pagetitle&quot; field.
The &quot;additional fields&quot; from the example above is located in a so called &quot;palette&quot; which is normally shown in the top frame when &quot;Show secondary options&quot; is disabled. Whether you prefer the one or the other solution is your choice.
This is an example of three Content Elements being edited at the same time. You can edit multiple records by using the links from the Web&gt;List module in single-table mode. Notice that not only are three records shown at the same time - it is also a limited number of fields shown for editing, here &quot;Header&quot; and &quot;Hide&quot;. You can combine this almost any way you like. This is of course very useful if you need to edit only the header of multiple records.</label>

If you click the icon of a file you will see a menu pop up with menu items related to the file or folder. This enables you to edit, rename and copy files to name a few.

&lt;b&gt;The &quot;TEMP&quot; folder&lt;/b&gt;
There is a special folder, the &quot;TEMP&quot; folder. This is meant to be used for temporary uploads of files that are going to be attached to TYPO3 records later. Content in the TEMP folder should be possible to flush once in a while when the folder becomes too crowded with files. So don't store persistent data in there!
The actual folder name is actually &quot;_temp_&quot;. The interface will just interprete this with &quot;TEMP&quot; in bold.
The same applies to folders named &quot;_recycler_&quot; - they will be trash cans in the folder tree.</label>

Normally there is a limit to the size of files you can upload. By default PHP will allow you to upload around 2MB. TYPO3 is configured to allow 10MB internally by default. These settings can be changed by your server administrator if you need them changed.

Notice that file uploads may take a significant amount of time, even if you have fast internet access via DSL etc. If you have large amount of files you want to upload - or if the files are very large - you should consider using an FTP client instead. It depends not on TYPO3 but on the webserver whether this is an options for you.</label>

			<label index="wizard_forms_wiz.alttitle">Forms Wizard</label>
			<label index="wizard_forms_wiz.description">The Form Wizard enables you to create form elements through a nice interface rather than &quot;coding&quot; a certain syntax for the elements.</label>
			<label index="wizard_forms_wiz.details">To the left in the form wizard you can add, delete and move items in the form around.
In the Element Type column you can select between various kinds of form elements such as regular input fields, text areas, selector boxes, checkboxes etc. Each form element also has a label field where you can enter a title for the field. Some fields also provide the possibility of checking for &quot;required&quot; values.
In the &quot;Detailed&quot; configuration column the options will depend on the form field type selected in the &quot;Element type&quot; column. The options here can be to enter elements for a selector box or enter the width of an input field. The &quot;Field:&quot; box is important since it defines the technical name of the form field. This is the name that people will see when they receive an email from the mail form.

&lt;b&gt;Custom applications of the form wizard&lt;/b&gt;
The most typical application of the Form wizard is with Content Elements of the type &quot;Form&quot; but the wizard can be used for other custom applications as well. Technical details about this is available in the links below.</label>

			<label index="shortcuts.alttitle">Backend Shortcuts</label>
			<label index="shortcuts.description">You can create shortcuts to modules in TYPO3 quite easily. The treat is that you can jump between screens in TYPO3 in &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; click rather than multiple clicks through backend modules etc. The frame also contains a field for entering a page or record id to edit or just search records.</label>
			<label index="shortcuts.details">In order to create a shortcut it must be supported by the module you want to create the shortcut to. Whether shortcuts are supported can be seen in the bottom of a module. If there is a small &quot;shortcut&quot; icon you can click it to create the shortcut.

In the shortcut frame you can also enter a page id to edit in the &quot;Edit Page ID&quot; box. This will load the current page module with the id provided in the box.

Only &quot;Admin&quot;-users can access the shortcut frame in TYPO3 by default. Other users must have it enabled by the User TSconfig option, &quot;options.shortcutFrame = 1&quot;. See link below for details (Admins).

Editing pages from an id is easy with the shortcut frame. Simply enter an integer number and that page will be loaded for editing. If you enter &quot;[table]:[id]&quot; then it will try to edit a record from the [table] table, for example &quot;tt_content:123&quot; will look for content element 123 (for admins only). Finally, if you enter a string that doesn't match a page or other record the Web&gt;List module will be invoked doing a search in the first database mount you have.</label>

			<label index="shortcuts.image_descr">To create a shortcut to a page, just click the short cut icon usually found in the bottom of pages.
You will have to confirm the creation of the shortcut. It is nothing dangerous - only annoying to clean up if you happen to create shortcuts against your own will. Just answer &quot;OK&quot; here.
When you answer &quot;OK&quot; you should immediately see the shortcut frame reload and a new icon (the module icon) appear. If you click this icon you will now jump to the page you created the shortcut from!
You can name shortcuts, you can even group them and share them. If you want to edit or delete a shortcut you select the &quot;Edit&quot; checkbox and then click the shortcut icon. This will reload the shortcut frame so you get a field for entering a title. You can also delete all shortcuts in a &quot;group&quot; - here, just click the &quot;0&quot; (zero) to the left of the icons and you will remove all shortcuts in the group.</label>

			<label index="workspaceSelector.description">By this selectorbox you can switch between the workspaces available to you. When you switch workspace the whole backend will reload.</label>
			<label index="workspaceSelector.details">There are two basic workspace types in TYPO3: The &quot;Live&quot; workspace and a number of &quot;Draft&quot; workspaces.
When working in the Live workspace all changes you make will take immediate effect. This is the default and traditional state of operation in TYPO3.
When working in the default Draft workspace or any customly created workspaces changes are not applied to the live website but rather made through new versions of any element editable. Since versioning doesn't apply to all elements in TYPO3 there are limitations to what can be done in draft workspaces; Only elements with versioning support can be edited and everything else is read-only. Draft workspaces allow preview in the frontend. When changes are final in a draft workspace they can be published into the live workspace.</label>
