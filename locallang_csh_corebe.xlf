You can configure the backend to display the menu in two alternative versions (useful on smaller screens); As a selector box or list of icons in the top frame of the backend.

When you click the little "+" or "-" icons next to the main modules, you can collapse (-) or expand (+) all the sub modules. By selecting the "Expand all" check box, all items are expanded.

        <source>TYPO3 has multiple caching systems:

&lt;b&gt;Database Cache&lt;/b&gt;
A very central cache is the database cache table, "cache_hash", which needs to be flushed after certain major changes in the system. You "clear all cache" by clicking the link with the blue icon. After this operation any website content should be re-generated from the sources rather than be delivered from caches. This operation clears &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; database tables registered as flushable cache tables.

&lt;b&gt;Cached PHP configuration files from Extensions&lt;/b&gt;
TYPO3 also caches small configuration scripts from extensions, "ext_localconf.php" and "ext_tables.php". These files are simply read from all installed extensions and concatenated into temporary PHP scripts found in the typo3conf/ folder, named "temp_CACHED_*.php". Sometimes you need to remove these files so TYPO3 re-writes them from the originals. This is done by the "Clear temp_CACHED" link.

&lt;b&gt;Notice:&lt;/b&gt; You should not clear these caches without a second thought. Clearing caches may affect performance on your server negatively for a while. Obviously the cached content has to be regenerated which takes time and under heavy load it might make your server un-available for a while.</source>

Some backend users will see only a part of the page tree for a website. This feature allows the administrator to configure backend users with different responsibilities for maintaining branches of the page tree.

        <source>By default 20 states of history data is preserved in TYPO3 and after a week it expires. The history is very useful for tracking changes to a record since you can see which user did what at which point in time - and roll back any changes you didn't like.
If you click the roll-back pencil you will revert the element to the state it had at that particular time.
If you click the Info icon you will see in detail what the difference is from current time to this state of the element.

&lt;b&gt;Configuring levels and expire times [for admins]&lt;/b&gt;
If you want to extend the number of history states to above the default 20 you can easily do so using Page TSconfig - meaning that it can even depend on the branch of the page tree where the record is stored! See link below.

&lt;b&gt;Notice:&lt;/b&gt; If you do not see red/green difference values, the server TYPO3 runs on does not support making difference views or it has been incorrectly configured to provide this feature.</source>

        <source>&lt;b&gt;Saving content&lt;/b&gt;
Just press one of the save-buttons in the top of bottom of the form. There are some variants allowing you to "Save and close document" or "Save document and View page". The latter will save the document and open a new window where the affected page is shown (be sure to disable pop-up blockers for this function!)

&lt;b&gt;Secondary options (palettes)&lt;/b&gt;
Fields in the editing forms are prioritized so that certain fields of generally lesser interest is moved to a so called "palette". By default it means that the fields appears in the top frame when you enter the field to which the secondary fields are associated. But you can also enable the fields to be shown in the main form which is more convenient some times - just select the "Show secondary options" checkbox (bottom of page).

&lt;b&gt;Editing multiple records at a time&lt;/b&gt;
From the Web&gt;List module you can activate editing of multiple records at a time. This is done when you list a single table and enable multiple columns for display (see Web&gt;List module for details) - then icons will link you to a form with multiple records displayed, possibly with only certain fields available for editing.

&lt;b&gt;Frontend Editing&lt;/b&gt;
Another way of editing records in TYPO3 is using the website frontend. Depending on your user credentials you will see small pencil icons in the frontend. When you click these you will be guided to a form where you can also change the content.

&lt;b&gt;Customize the forms [for Admins]&lt;/b&gt;
You can customize the TCEforms in many ways using User TSconfig and Page TSconfig. See links below.</source>

        <source>This is how a typical record is edited in TYPO3. The form display is standardized for all types of records. You will always see the same buttons in the top for saving or closing. In the blue bar you will see the type of record (table name) and the ID number that each record has (uid). Here the record is a page with ID "2" and the title "Content Elements".
In the bottom of the editing page you will find additional options for the interface. You can select "Show field descriptions" if you want a small text shown for each element that explains what it is used for. Also "Show secondary options" is very important since it will show additional form fields in the main forms (from "palettes").
Here "Show secondary options (palettes)" is enabled. The result is that a number of additional fields of "lower priority" is shown under the "Pagetitle" field.
The "additional fields" from the example above is located in a so called "palette" which is normally shown in the top frame when "Show secondary options" is disabled. Whether you prefer the one or the other solution is your choice.
This is an example of three Content Elements being edited at the same time. You can edit multiple records by using the links from the Web&gt;List module in single-table mode. Notice that not only are three records shown at the same time - it is also a limited number of fields shown for editing, here "Header" and "Hide". You can combine this almost any way you like. This is of course very useful if you need to edit only the header of multiple records.</source>

&lt;b&gt;The "TEMP" folder&lt;/b&gt;
There is a special folder, the "TEMP" folder. This is meant to be used for temporary uploads of files that are going to be attached to TYPO3 records later.

The actual folder name is actually "_temp_". The interface will just interprete this with "TEMP" in bold.
The same applies to folders named "_recycler_" - they will be trash cans in the folder tree.</source>

        <source>In order to create a shortcut it must be supported by the module you want to create the shortcut to. Whether shortcuts are supported can be seen in the bottom of a module. If there is a small "shortcut" icon you can click it to create the shortcut.

In the shortcut frame you can also enter a page id to edit in the "Edit Page ID" box. This will load the current page module with the id provided in the box.

Only "Admin"-users can access the shortcut frame in TYPO3 by default. Other users must have it enabled by the User TSconfig option, "options.shortcutFrame = 1". See link below for details (Admins).

Editing pages from an id is easy with the shortcut frame. Simply enter an integer number and that page will be loaded for editing. If you enter "[table]:[id]" then it will try to edit a record from the [table] table, for example "tt_content:123" will look for content element 123 (for admins only). Finally, if you enter a string that doesn't match a page or other record the Web&gt;List module will be invoked doing a search in the first database mount you have.</source>

You will have to confirm the creation of the shortcut. It is nothing dangerous - only annoying to clean up if you happen to create shortcuts against your own will. Just answer "OK" here.
When you answer "OK" you should immediately see the shortcut frame reload and a new icon (the module icon) appear. If you click this icon you will now jump to the page you created the shortcut from!
