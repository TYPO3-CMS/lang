			<label index=".description">Filemounts describe a filepath on the server, relative or absolute.</label>
			<label index=".details">By creating a file mount record and placing a reference to it in a Backend usergroup you can allow a user access to the file mount in the File&gt;List module.
Filemounts may also configure access to a path on the server to which the user has FTP-access. Just remember to set file-permissions on the server correctly so the webserver user (which PHP is running as) has at least read access to the FTP-dir.
You can only mount absolute paths if they are within the base path set in $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[BE][lockRootPath]</label>

			<label index="title.description">Enter a title for the filemount. The title will appear as the name of the file mount when it is applied to users and groups.</label>
			<label index="_title.image">EXT:lang/cshimages/be_groups_5.png</label>
			<label index="path.description">Enter the path of the filemount, relative or absolute depending on the settings of BASE.</label>
			<label index="path.details">If BASE is set to relative, the path mounted is found in the subfolder &quot;fileadmin/&quot; of the website. Then you should enter the subfolder in &quot;fileadmin/&quot; as path. For instance if you want to mount access to &quot;fileadmin/user_uploads/all/&quot; then enter the value &quot;user_uploads/all&quot; as the value of PATH.
If BASE is absolute you should enter the absolute path on the server, eg. &quot;/home/ftp_upload&quot; or &quot;C:/home/ftp_upload&quot;. Further you must make sure the configuration variable $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[BE][lockRootPath] contains the first part of the path you want to mount.

&lt;strong&gt;Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; In any case, make sure the webserver user which PHP is running as has &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; read-access to the path. If not, the mount will simply not appear without any warnings.
If you have problems - especially with absolute mounts - try to mount something &quot;simple&quot; like a relative path in fileadmin. If that is working well, try the absolute path.

Your PHP-configuration may also impose other restrictions on you if safe_mode or open_basedir is enabled. Then use relative paths.</label>
