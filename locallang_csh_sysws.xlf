"Page" is a versioning type where a page record and child records from specified tables (like "Content Elements" and "Language Overlay Records") are copied along. This form is more complex but offers flexibility in terms of rearrangement of elements on the page.
"Branch" versioning is where a page is versionized and all subpages and content is copied along. This can have quite heavy implications on data duplication and is recommended only in special circumstances.
